I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't be boring.
I always had a repulsive need to be something more than human. I felt very puny as a human. I thought, 'Fuck that. I want to be a superhuman.
I'm not a prophet or a stone aged man, just a mortal with potential of a superman. I'm living on.
I'm an instant star. Just add water and stir.
The truth is of course is that there is no journey. We are arriving and departing all at the same time.
I'm always amazed that people take what I say seriously. I don't even take what I am seriously.
To not be modest about it, you'll find that with only a couple of exceptions, most of the musicians that I've worked with have done their best work by far with me.
Frankly, I mean, sometimes the interpretations I've seen on some of the songs that I've written are a lot more interesting than the input that I put in.
I'm just an individual who doesn't feel that I need to have somebody qualify my work in any particular way. I'm working for me.
I wanted to prove the sustaining power of music.
