Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
Art is never finished, only abandoned.
When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.
It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.
The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.
Learning never exhausts the mind.
As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.
The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.
Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence.
While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.
