For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.
What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?
I dream of painting and then I paint my dream.
I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process.
I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.
Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.
I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.
The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore.
I am still far from being what I want to be, but with God's help I shall succeed.
In spite of everything I shall rise again: I will take up my pencil, which I have forsaken in my great discouragement, and I will go on with my drawing.
