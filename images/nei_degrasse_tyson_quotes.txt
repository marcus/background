The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.
Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes.... The only people who still call hurricanes acts of God are the people who write insurance forms.
Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.
Science is something to be proud of, it allows us to understand the world in spite of ourselves.
